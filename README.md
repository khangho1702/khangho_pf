# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with modern web technologies to create a fast, responsive, and visually engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Modern Styling:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first design.
- **Fully Responsive:** Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** The background image changes as the user scrolls through different sections of the page, powered by the Intersection Observer API.
- **Performance Optimized:** Uses React's lazy loading and Suspense to load components on demand, improving initial load times.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Customization

Most of the personal content (name, description, links, etc.) is centralized in the `src/root.link.js` file for easy updating. You can modify the constants in this file to change the content throughout the portfolio.
